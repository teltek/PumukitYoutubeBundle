PuMuKIT Youtube Bundle
=======================

Bundle based on [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) to work with the [PuMuKIT Video Platform](https://github.com/pumukit/PuMuKIT/blob/master/README.md).

This bundle allows uploading and publish videos from PuMuKIT into a YouTube channel.

This synchronization can be done manually from the command line or configuring the Cron tool to do it automatically according to a time schedule.
You can find more information on this in the Configuration guide.
